## Core Concepts

### AI Model Integration

Integrating AI models involves connecting the application to various large models. This allows the application to leverage the capabilities of these models for various tasks.

### Prompt Engineering

Crafting effective prompts is crucial for getting the best responses from AI models. This involves understanding how to phrase questions and requests.

### RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines retrieval methods with generation techniques. This allows for more accurate and context-aware responses from AI models.

### Vector Databases

Vector databases store data in a way that allows for efficient similarity searches. This is essential for applications that require quick access to large datasets.

### Tool Calling

Tool calling refers to the ability of the AI to invoke external tools or services. This enhances the functionality of the AI and allows it to perform more complex tasks.

### MCP

The Model Context Protocol helps maintain context during interactions with AI models. This ensures that the AI can provide relevant responses based on previous interactions.

### AI Agent Development

Developing AI agents involves creating intelligent systems that can perform tasks autonomously. This requires a solid understanding of the concepts mentioned above.

### Cursor AI Tools

Cursor AI tools provide additional functionality for managing AI projects. These tools can streamline development and enhance productivity.

## Technologies Used
